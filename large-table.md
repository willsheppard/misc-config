Sometimes you want to display a wide table (more long than tall),
i.e. the properties of each entry are more numerous than the number of entries.

The challenge is to do this in a manner that:

- is easy to generate
  - confluence: yes, natively
  - markdown: yes, with 3rd-party generator
- is easy to edit
  - confluence: yes
  - markdown: no, you have to line up the spaces to make it legible in edit mode, and that's very fiddly. Note: github editor can toggle wrap mode :)
- it portable between systems
  - confluence: yes, copy & paste into excel or equivalent
  - markdown: yes, if target has markdown importer
- can be arbitrarily wide and still legible, even if it requires zooming out or scrolling
  - confluence: no
  - markdown: yes, at least github flavour
