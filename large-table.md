Sometimes you want to display a wide table (more long than tall),
i.e. the properties of each entry are more numerous than the number of entries.

The challenge is to do this in a manner that:

- is easy to generate (confluence)
- is easy to edit (confluence)
- it portable between systems (markdown)
- can be arbitrarily wide and still legible (zoom out or scroll. NOT Confluence)
